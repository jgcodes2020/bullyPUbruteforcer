# Bully PU BruteForcer
We have gone to space and back. Now we will shoot a rock into space at 0.1 lightspeed, have it bounce 20 times, to come back and hit us in the back.

"bully_bruteforce_manybullies_BETA_NOTQUITEWORKING" is a WIP file that is used by a few people, but most people use the "bully_bruteforce_faster" file. I made some modifications to it so our results will SUPER match Tyler's ideal solution. It's more complete, but not fully. Ideally, the completion of manybullies will be the complete version.

1. Take the .py file and the .m64 and a sm64_jp.dll file (the .dll is safe to share but it's big and i was too lazy to wait for it to upload to git).
2. Then make sure the .py file will go to and read the .m64 and the .dll files.
3. Then choose the speed you want to start searching, how you want to increment your speed, and how you want to search angles for each speed value.
4. You might wanna choose your output format such that it'll be easy to paste into our community spreadsheet here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CpZFfVa3po3aT9nqWaiSEOcnkxUE-TnxnkCAwmqGU_U/ (You should ask me for edit permission. Just a single click to make a request.)
